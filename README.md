# websec
Repository for bachelor project about digital privacy. Has been reset due to several issues early on. All should be fully up-to-date now.

It appears that all contributor-data was also wiped when the repo was reset. This was made mainly with pair-programming. By Brusevolddalen (https://github.com/brusevolddalen) and me.

The URL was initially actionscript.no, as we was able to borrow that domain for free by a teacher at university. After the project was over, it was moved to websec.co.
