		<h1>PASSWORDS</h1>
		<p>A password is a part of an authentication process. Most authentication systems require a username and a password. If your password is strong, and kept safe, so is your account. We will explain how to make good passwords, and ways to handle/store passwords.
			We will also look at some other authentication systems.</p>





		<h2 id="STRONG">PASSWORD STRENGTH</h2>
		<P>When measuring password strength it is usually measured by how long it takes to crack by brute force attacks, or other methods. Brute force is a type of attack where the attacker systematically check all possible combinations before gaining access.
			This method is best when trying to crack smaller passwords simply because the shorter password, the less combinations. When dealing with longer passwords, attackers will use methods like a dictionary attack because people often use common words in
			their passwords.</P>

		<p>The most important part of having a good password, is that it is unique. You should never re-use passwords. A password should not include personal information such as name, birth date or similar information. The reason for this is because it will then
			become easier to guess the password if someone has basic information about you.</p>
		<p>When creating a password it should have at least 12 characters and contain both upper- and lowercase letters along with symbols and numbers when allowed. It is also a very good idea to avoid patterns in your password. Some of the most used password
			patterns are: keyboard patterns (qwe123), usernames, geographic names and birthdates. When using symbols and numbers you should not just replace letters with common replacements (a=4, i=1 or !, 3=E etc).</p>
		<p>You can also use random generators (<a href="#PASSWORDGENERATOR">like the one below!</a>), but unless you are using a password manager it can be very hard to remember these.</p>

		<H2 id="MFA">MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION</H2>
		<p>Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) is a method of granting access to the user by demanding more than one way of authentication. A common 2 factor authentication method is used in cash withdrawal. When withdrawing cash you need your card, and a PIN code only
			you know.</p>
		<p>You also have mobile authentication, token generators, secret questions and biometric authentication. Some of these solutions are very safe, while others might be more damaging than helpful.</p>
		<p>Mobile authentication, token generators and biometric authentications systems adds a extra layer of security to your account. You will usually be asked to input this authentication after entering a valid password. Biometric Authentication has become
			more common lately because of fingerprint scanners on smartphones.</p>
		<p>Secret questions on the other hand can be more damaging than helpful. If you answer the question “What is your mother's maiden name” or something similar truthfully, someone who knows basic information about you, might be able to gain access that way.</p>


		<h2 id="PASSPHRASES">PASSPHRASES</h2>
		<p>A option for passwords are passphrases. These are much longer than passwords and contains several words. Whereas a password usually has 6-12 characters, passphrases are often between 20-30 characters. This can make brute force attacks very time consuming.</p>
		<p>When making a passphrase you have make sure it is long enough to be hard to guess, while still being able to remember it, unless you use a password manager. Never make your passphrase a famous quote from movies, TV, books, etc. You should not make it
			relate to you personally, because this means that someone who knows you well has an easier time guessing your passphrase. Your passphrases also has to be unique. You can use our <a href="#PASSPHRASEGENERATOR">passphrase generator below</a> to see some good passphrases</p>

		<h2 id="SECURE">SECURE YOUR PASSWORDS</h2>
		<p>The first step to making sure your password stay private, is to never share your passwords with ANYONE! It is also a good idea to change your passwords every three months.</p>
		<p>Keep your eyes out for news about password leaks or hacks. Over the last few years this has become an increasingly big problem. You can also use the tool below to check if your email or username has been involved in any hacks.</p>
		<p>The best way to secure your passwords is to use a password manager. Password managers work by creating an encrypted database (online or offline) and storing all your passwords. You can also use the manager to randomly generate a password. Password managers
			will create far more secure passwords than most people will. To gain access to your password database, you need a master password. This should be a very strong passphrase. Even though this makes password managers very secure you should enable two factor
			authentication if supported. If you want to use a password manager, make sure it is from a trusted source or preferably use open source software. A very popular password manager is LastPass, but we feel that this is one you absolutely should not use.
			The reason behind this is that LastPass has had several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass#Security_issues">security issues</a> throughout it's lifetime. Some better choices would be <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>
			(open source, but no cloud sync) or <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> (not open source, but has cloud sync. Also more user friendly than KeePass)</p>
