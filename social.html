		<h1>SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>
		<p>Social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and many others has become extremely popular. The vast majority of people are using one or several platforms. It can help us keep in contact with people, and share moments in our lives with others. Like
			anything that holds a lot of personal information, it's very attractive to criminals. Therefore it is a good idea to be cautious when using it.</p>


		<h2 id="ACCOUNTS">ACCOUNTS</h2>
		<p>Anyone with access to your account can potentially do a great amount of damage. Access can be gained in many different ways, both with physical access to your computer/phone, or without. Your photos, videos, contacts, interests, conversations and so
			on, will be visible to the attacker. Simple sabotage can be brushed off as a joke, or have extensive consequences.</p>

		<p>When big social media platforms gets hacked and someone gains access to a large amount of accounts they will usually be sold on a darknet market or used for phishing, scams or spreading of malware.</p>

		<p>Itâ€™s easy to set up a fake profile. Either to use the service without revealing your identity, or pretending to be someone else. If someone with a friends name and profile picture wants to add you, even if you already have them in your list, it can
			be tempting to accept the invitation. Maybe they lost access to their other account, or simply made a new account. On Facebook, the current profile image is always public, and can thus be used. If you stay clear of social media, you can have an even
			higher risk of being imposed, as your friends might add the thinking "Oh (insert name) is finally on Facebook!". You can search your name in a search engine to check if there are any accounts you have not made.</p>

					<li>Think twice before accepting a friend request.</li>
					<li>Your Facebook profile picture is always public.</li>
					<li>Be careful with what you share.</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
		</div>



		<h2 id="PRIVACY">PRIVACY SETTINGS</h2>
		<p>By default, your privacy is rarely prioritized on social media. It it advised to go through the privacy settings to make sure that you do not share things with more people than you might expect. If you put up a lot of photos, it can be preferable
			to only have them visible to friends, especially if they are of a more intimate nature. There has been cases where pictures are stolen and used for different kinds of advertising. Pretending to be someone else is also fully possible. It is easy to
			accidentally share too much. Maybe you want to make a post, but forgot that your location would be included. This can be both perfectly fine, or very bad. As with any online service, it can be very advisable to learn, and fully understand how it works,
			and what your options are.</p>
		<p>You might not want to post vacation pictures, visible to everyone. If it's easy to find your address, you could get robbed as the thief now knows you are not at home. You only have control over what YOU put up. If you end up in a picture taken by someone else, your face might get detected, and
			they might want to tag you. There are usually ways to prevent this without your permission, it is however not a default option.</p>
